## Further Discussion

Friends of mine on D-D suggested that this proposition is anti-poor, and anti-education.

The arguments seem to be that-

A) Cigarette taxes are regressive and disprotionately affect the poor. This might be true, but *all* taxes disprotionately affect the poor. This is also regarded as a sin tax, which some are against on principle. I continue to dismiss these concerns because of the greater good of increasing the quality of life and alleviating the burden of smoking related disease on the health care system.

B) The tax benefits early education. The argument is that if this tax is *too effective* and elimenates smoking, then the school will lose the funding from this tax that it will have grown to depend on. This is, of course, stupid.

Decision: this tax is neither anti-poor, nor anti-education. It is pro-health and, if I may repurpose a term, pro-life.
