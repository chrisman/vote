# Vote

This is a description of how I plan to vote, and [why](values/README.md).

## Elections

### Upcoming elections

- [2020-11-03: general election](2020/11-03/README.md)

### Past elections

- [2020-06-30: colorado primary](2020/06-30/README.md)
- [2019-11-05](2019/11-05/README.md)

## Goals

These are my goals:

1. **Articulation**: Analyize and think more carefully about my options. Because writing is thinking.

2. **Collaboration**: Open source my decision making process through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

3. **Documentation**: Document my decisions for my own use, so I can reflect back on them, and see where my beliefs have changed over time and for what reason.

## Contributing

In order to achieve goal number two (Open source my decision making process through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests) I need discourse and feedback.

Please try to influence me, educate me, change my mind, argue with me, point out where I'm wrong, etc.

- [Submit an issue](https://github.com/chrisman/vote/issues/new)

- Fork this repo and send me a pull request

- g-mail me at christopher.p.brown

- I guess you could even twitter me @chrismanbrown if that's easiest for you, but I don't check twitter super often.

## Inspiration

This repo is inspired by, and is a fork of, [sreynen/vote](https://github.com/sreynen/vote).

It is also a sort of spiritual successor to [busterbenson/public](https://github.com/busterbenson/public).
